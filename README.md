Community effort to ease in newcomers to Aurelia.
It is a bit frustrating for developers trying out Aurelia now.
A lot of choices: CLI, JSPM, Webpack. Typescript ES6 etc.
Onboarding experience got to be simpler.

Let's help out fellow developers and gather all the pieces together (-:

Content is the king.
Structure will follow.


# What you can find here

* [Guides](guides) a cookbook of aurelia task oriented recipes
* [Config files explained](config-files) A collection of config files to get you started from scratch. And in case you ever wondered what that line in config file does? Here we try to explain all those settings and how they affect your project. Send a pull request to add your own commented config.


# How to contribute
There is a simple canban board for tracking our progress:
https://github.com/aurelia-contrib/aurelia-getting-started/projects

Most issues have an educated guess estimate in hours. Feel free to pick any.
If it is labeled 'contribute_to_core' then actual Pull Request should target one of the core repositories.
We try to provide guidance on where exactly the contribution is needed and where to get information.


Write a small document for one of the topics listed in issues and create a pull request.

If you feel there is a need for article and it is not listed in issues, create an issue.

If there is a common question that can be added to F.A.Q. Well... you get the drill.

# How else can I help Aurelia?
